# Superpy

## Description:
Superpy is a Python command-line tool (CLI) designed to help businesses manage their product inventory efficiently. It simplifies the process of tracking purchases and sales, calculating profit, and monitoring stock levels.

- Record purchases with details including product name, quantity, price, and expiration date.
- Record sales transactions, ensuring the product is in stock.
- Generate detailed reports on revenue, profit, and current inventory.

## How to Use:
For a more in-depth exploration of creating and interacting with the CLI, I refer to the [UsaGuide](UsageGuide.md).
